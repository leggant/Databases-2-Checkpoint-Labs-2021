# Joins Exercise 5‐2

## Using sakila database - Checkpoint Lab

1. Get a list of all film titles and their inventory number – even those we don’t have.
   - You might like to limit the output to 200 to check you have everything looking like this

```sql

```
2. Which films do we not have in stock?
   - There are 42 records beginning with:

![image-20210818235615536](images\image-20210818235615536.png)

```sql

```
3. List the number of films in which each actor has featured (sort the output in descending order of the number of films)

```sql

```

### Techniques from this week

4. The store uses a formula to calculate the return‐on‐investment (or ROI) which is (rental_rate / replacement_cost * 100). 
   - List the films, rental replacement cost and ROI which have an ROI more than 10. Order by ROI. *Only have the formula once in the query*

```sql

```
5.  List the maximum, minimum and average film replacement cost using subselects in the select clause only (do not use a FROM clause in the main query) – yes this is silly.

## Student Database on SQLite

### Techniques from earlier this week Not trivial, you’ll have to work on these.

6. List the students as pairs who come from the same sized high school. Order by school size.
   - Only list one pair of each student e.g. if you have Alice and Bob in a record don’t also list Bob and Alice (unless they are different students – we have two different AMY’s).
   - Work through this in stages – removing redundant pairs is the last step. You might like to display more information while developing the query (e.g. sid)
```sql

```
7. List each student that has made an application and the number of ITP’s they have applied to.
   - This is a simple inner join but I did use something introduced in passing today to get this.
```sql

```

## Subqueries and Outer Joins

8. Which students have not applied anywhere?
```sql

```
9. List a count of the number of applications made by each student
```sql

```
10. List the number of institutions that each student has applied to:
```sql

```
11. How many students have applied to each institution?
```sql

```
